# GravityWaterSensor
GWS is a low cost well sensor designed to measure the height of water in submerge bore and recharge wells, developed and conceived during the Bali Fab Festival in 2022. 
The project has been developed in conjunction wih the IDEP Foundation to support water protection and educaion programmes across the Balinese Province.
Gravity Well Sensor is the product of a small team of designers, makers and engineers who were part of the Fab Island Challenge during the Bali Fab Fest – traveling from Fab Lab’s across the globe to participate in a design co-creation exercise over 10 days.
Our mission is to develop water based sensor technologies that measure, share and centralise data
